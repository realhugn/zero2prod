        HttpServer::new does not take App as argument - it wants a closure that returns an App struct.
        This is to support actix-webâ€™s runtime model: actix-web will spin up a worker process for each
        available core on your machine.
        Each worker runs its own copy of the application built by HttpServer calling the very same closure
        that HttpServer::new takes as argument ->  connection has to be cloneable => Wrap it in ARC which means
        each instance of the application will have a pointer to PgConnection instead of a raw copy of it.
